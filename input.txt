ABSTRACTIONAdouble spooks the world, the double of abstraction. Thefortunes of states and armies, companies and communitiesdepend on it. All contending classes, be they ruling or ruled,revere it—yet fear it. Ours is a world that ventures blindlyinto the new with its fingers crossed.All classes fear this relentless abstraction of the world, onwhich their fortunes yet depend. All classes but one: thehacker class. We are the hackers of abstraction. We producenew concepts, new perceptions, new sensations, hacked outof raw data. Whatever code we hack, be it programminglanguage, poetic language, math or music, curves or col-orings, we are the abstracters of new worlds. Whether wecome to represent ourselves as researchers or authors, art-ists or biologists, chemists or musicians, philosophers orprogrammers, each of these subjectivities is but a fragmentof a class still becoming, bit by bit, aware of itself as such.And yet we don’t quite know who we are. That is why thisbook seeks to make manifest our origins, our purpose andour interests. A hacker manifesto: Not the only manifesto, asit is in the nature of the hacker to differ from others, to dif-fer even from oneself, over time. To hack is to differ. A[002][003][001]

hacker manifesto cannot claim to represent what refusesrepresentation.Hackers create the possibility of new things entering theworld. Not always great things, or even good things, butnew things. In art, in science, in philosophy and culture, inany production of knowledge where data can be gathered,where information can be extracted from it, and where inthat information new possibilities for the world produced,there are hackers hacking the new out of the old. While wecreate these new worlds, we do not possess them. Thatwhich we create is mortgaged to others, and to the interestsof others, to states and corporations who monopolize themeans for making worlds we alone discover. We do not ownwhat we produce—it owns us.Hackers use their knowledge and their wits to maintaintheir autonomy. Some take the money and run. (We mustlive with our compromises.) Some refuse to compromise.(We live as best we can.) All too often those of us who takeone of these paths resent those who take the other. One lotresents the prosperity it lacks, the other resents the liberty itlacks to hack away at the world freely. What eludes thehacker class is a more abstract expression of our interests asa class, and of how this interest may meet those of others inthe world.Hackers are not joiners. We’re not often willing to sub-merge our singularity. What the times call for is a collectivehack that realizes a class interest based on an alignment ofdifferences rather than a coercive unity. Hackers are a class,abstraction[004][005][006]

but an abstract class. A class that makes abstractions, and aclass made abstract. To abstract hackers as a class is to ab-stract the very concept of class itself. The slogan of thehacker class is not the workers of the world united, but theworkings of the world untied.Everywhere abstraction reigns, abstraction made concrete.Everywhere abstraction’s straight lines and pure curves or-der matters along complex but efficient vectors. But whereeducation teaches what one may produce with an abstrac-tion, the knowledge most useful for the hacker class is ofhow abstractions are themselves produced. Deleuze: “Ab-stractions explain nothing, they themselves have to be ex-plained.”*Abstraction may be discovered or produced, may be mate-rial or immaterial, but abstraction is what every hack pro-duces and affirms. To abstract is to construct a plane uponwhich otherwise different and unrelated matters may bebrought into many possible relations. To abstract is to ex-press the virtuality of nature, to make known some instanceof its possibilities, to actualize a relation out of infinite rela-tionality, to manifest the manifold.History is the production of abstraction and the abstrac-tion of production. What makes life differ in one age afterthe next is the application of new modes of abstractionto the task of wresting freedom from necessity. History isthe virtual made actual, one hack after another. Historyis the cumulative qualitative differentiation of nature as itis hacked.abstraction[007][008][009]

Out of the abstraction of nature comes its productivity, andthe production of a surplus over and above the necessitiesof survival. Out of this expanding surplus over necessitycomes an expanding capacity to hack, again and again, pro-ducing further abstractions, further productivity, further re-lease from necessity—at least in potential. But the hackingof nature, the production of surplus, does not make us free.Again and again, a ruling class arises that controls the sur-plus over bare necessity and enforces new necessities onthose peoples who produce this very means of escaping ne-cessity.What makes our times different is the appearance on thehorizon of possibility of a new world, long imagined—aworld free from necessity. The production of abstraction hasreached the threshold where it can break the shackles hold-ing hacking fast to outdated and regressive class interests,once and for all. Debord: “The world already possesses thedream of a time whose consciousness it must now possessin order to actually live it.”*Invention is the mother of necessity. While all states de-pend on abstraction for the production of their wealth andpower, the ruling class of any given state has an uneasy rela-tionship to the production of abstraction in new forms. Theruling class seeks always to control innovation and turn it toits own ends, depriving the hacker of control of her or hiscreation, and thereby denying the world as a whole the rightto manage its own development.The production of new abstraction always takes placeamong those set apart by the act of hacking. We others whoabstraction[010][011][012][013]

have hacked new worlds out of old, in the process becomenot merely strangers apart but a class apart. While we re-cognize our distinctive existence as a group, as program-mers or artists or writers or scientists or musicians, werarely see these ways of representing ourselves as mere frag-ments of a class experience. Geeks and freaks become whatthey are negatively, through exclusion by others. Togetherwe form a class, a class as yet to hack itself into existence asitself—and for itself.It is through the abstract that the virtual is identified, pro-duced and released. The virtual is not just the potential la-tent in matter, it is the potential of potential. To hack is toproduce or apply the abstract to information and express thepossibility of new worlds, beyond necessity.All abstractions are abstractions of nature. Abstractions re-lease the potential of the material world. And yet abstrac-tion relies on the material world’s most curious quality—in-formation. Information can exist independently of a givenmaterial form, but cannot exist without any material form.It is at once material and immaterial. The hack depends onthe material qualities of nature, and yet discovers somethingindependent of a given material form. It is at once materialand immaterial. It discovers the immaterial virtuality of thematerial, its qualities of information.Abstraction is always an abstraction of nature, a processthat creates nature’s double, a second nature, a space of hu-man existence in which collective life dwells among its ownproducts and comes to take the environment it produces tobe natural.abstraction[014][015][016]
